use ML to train model to detect drops, could use labeled drop points from my rekordbox...

For even better detection:

Analyze low-frequency energy increase.

Use librosa.feature.rms() (volume) + spectral_centroid (brightness).

Use a machine learning model trained on labeled drop points (big project, but possible).
